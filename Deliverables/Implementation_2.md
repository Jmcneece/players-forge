## 4. Code Quality

In order for the team to manage high quality code, we relied on:
- Paired Programming\
    Paired programming was done over Discord, where we took turns with ideas and writing for the second
    implementation of PlayersForge. This was a difficult task to maintain, but we believe that the practice
    allowed for the creation of good code quality.
- KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)\
    KISS managed to assist in keeping code simple and to the point in a variety of different ways. One way
    is by the front-end of the website, where we decided to create a simple yet effective UI. Another way 
    that KISS was implemented is within the code. There is nothing that is overly complicated as long as
    the reader has some expeirence in Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\
    Don't repeat yourself is a very important rule to follow within programming, which is why it was followed
    in this project. Repetition was kept to a low, and allowed for easy reading of code and the ability to have
    only the necessary amount of code.
- Assigning Roles
    In order for our team members to branch out and experience different areas of programming, as well as show
    the experience that they have in others, we assigned different parts to multiple people in order to work together,
    and then switched those roles with another pair to review the code and come up with new ideas as needed.

## 5. Lessons Learned
- Learning to pair program online is difficult; as a team, we struggled with meeting up and 
collaborating due to having to abide by the regulations set for the pandemic. Though attempts were made with the use of screen sharing over Discord/Zoom, we found it too much of a hindrance than if we were working together in person. 

- Developing for a client-facing product can be frustrating. Our webpage functions rely heavily on the backend logic we have implemented. Unfortunately because of the backend, the website is required to be ran on a local machine in order to properly interact with it. This was the best way for us to implement the uploading and downloading of specific files with the time it takes to learn backend development and have it completed by the due date

- Creating an estimate for the development time of user stories is nearly impossible, especially when working with a new paradigm and backend. User stories that we were excited to implement such as an active community discussion board were simply too much of a task for the time allotted
