# D.4 - Implementation

Group 08 - PlayersForge\
Group Members: Kylie Cook, Fernando Diaz, David Hermann, Jared McNeece, Conrad Murphy, Noah Olono

## 1. Introduction

### Paragraph description
PlayersForge is a website dedicated to bringing mods to gamers. From classics to new games, PlayersForge 
is built with ease of access in mind. Whether the game is not supported by the Steam Workshop or is 
old, our website lets you search for your favorites or new additions easily.

### Value Proposition
PlayersForge is the easiest way to find a mod because many mods are tailored to the needs of its users, 
including a recommendation system.

## 3. Adopted Technologies
Our website is currently a simple minimum viable product made with only HTML and CSS. 
We plan to implement a database written in Python that holds the mods, games for which those 
mods are made, user profiles, etc. Python is a language that we all have experience with using and 
is one that should be easy to learn and write.

## 4. Learning / Training
The primary learning strategy employed by our team has been dividing the research and distributing 
it to group members in equal amounts and based off their interests. With some of us having a previous 
foundation with web programming and development, we decided it would be best to implement the use of 
paired programming over screen-share to allow less experienced members to gain an understanding, while 
also maintaining a standardized style of code. Along with the strategy of "divide and conquer", we also 
have made use of meeting online during the week to establish progression and how on track we are to meet that 
week's deadline. We consolidated larger tasks for the entire group to work on together.

Through the use of both Discord and Trello, we have been able to report back and educate the rest of the 
group on what our findings are. We've also created several designated channels for specific parts of the 
project, including: a team-member made tutorial for setting up Github desktop, important documents/links, 
as well as a general chat with important weekly information pinned. 

## 5. Deployment
We used Amazon Web Services' GitHub integration to push code to our website. See the current website [at this link](https://www.playersforge.net/).

## 6. Licensing
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3. See [the license here](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge/blob/main/LICENSE) 
for details. The reason we chose this license is because it is a generally applicable license which allows multiple
freedoms.

## 8. Look & Feel
The website was designed with minimalism in mind. Many modder oriented websites over saturate their pages with excessive colors and graphics. Our website was made to make the experience of finding mods as easy as possible.

## 9. Lessons Learned
We learned how to work as a team to contribute to code, even while we are all separated by distance. We also learned how to set up an AWS server and how to use GitHub to organize our development and integrate licensing. For our next release, we plan to incorporate back-end code for our database.
