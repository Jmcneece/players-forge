# D.2 Requirements

Group 08 - PlayersForge\
Group Members: Fernando Diaz and company

## 1. Positioning 
**1.1. Problem Statement**

The problem of searching for and downloading game mods affects people who
don't have the time, patience, or experience with technology and mods;
the impact of which is spending extensive time on different websites to download
new mods or update ones that are already in their use.

**1.2. Product Positioning Statement** 

For people that would rather find and download mods from a single and easily accessible website,
PlayersForge is a modding collection that allows users of various gaming experiences to 
search for mods that match the games that they play in one space. Unlike GameBanana, our product
combines clean, organized, and attractive design with game mod searching.

**1.3. Value Proposition and consumer segment.**


PlayersForge is a game mod search website that allows gamers and modders with limited 
to extensive modding experiences to find and download mods that match their game 
preferences inside of a simple, convenient, and eye-appealing design.


## 2. Stakeholders

- Users: Users will include gamers and modders alike. They will be the ones who will upload and download the mods from our website.
- Developers: Developers are the ones responsible for the creation of the website.
- Communities: The ones who will be looking at our website for the potential to share and download mods for a 	specific game. 

## 3. Functional Requirements (features)
1. Allow users to download published mods for free without an account.
2. Allow users to search for mods based on key words and categories and receive results sorted by relevance and popularity.
3. Alert users with notifications if any relevant mods or games receive updates.
4. Allow users to create an account and become a registered member.
5. Allow members to publish mods.

12. Provide users with community pages and tabs where users can communicate with each other.

## 4. Non Functional Requirements

## 5. MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

The MVP for our project will be the website itself. The features we are going to validate are the ability to upload and download mods. 
The ability to create an account will also be required to upload mods. We will validate the features by using the website for ourselves 
by putting us in User role which is making sure we can create an account then seeing if we can download and upload mods. 
The site doesn’t have to have all of the aesthetic features yet but must be functional.
