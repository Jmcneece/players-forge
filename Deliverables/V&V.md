## 1. Description

PlayersForge is a website with a dedicated, free to join community for uploading and downloading mods. 
Users can access the PlayersForge website on their web browser and sign up to become a part of the 
modding community. Modders also can gain access to mods such as skins and maps without signing up.
Each of the mods are categorized  and sorted by the game they are for and the type of mod.

The PlayersForge website is currently still in early development, with multiple features to be 
implemented in the near future such as a community forum and dedicated mod pages. The website 
provides a sleek and simple design, allowing for users to easily navigate and locate their desired 
mods. The homepage currently features the most popular or most downloaded mods.

  ### 2.2 Integration Test
  
  ### 2.2.1
  The test framework used to develop the integration tests was unittest.
  
  ### 2.2.2
  Automated Integration Tests [Location](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge/blob/main/playersforge/tests.py)
  
  ### 2.2.3
  [Integration Test](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge/blob/main/playersforge/tests.py#L138)\
  The test_integration_signup() method puts together three different components. First,  we rediret to the signup page. The signup component is initiated, and a user signs up 
  with the email 'someone', username 'someone', and password 'someone'. Then, we check to make sure that the page was redirected to the 
  user's new profile page after posting (since the user automatically gets logged in after signing up).
  Then, we get the upload page from the user's profile page (the user wouldn't be able to get into the profile or upload page if they were not signed up/logged in.
  We then post a new mod to upload and check to make sure that it redirects to the same page, which means it was successful. After that, we get the logout page,
  which automatically logs the user out and redirects them to the main home page.
  
  ### 2.2.4

  ### 2.3 Acceptance
  
  ### 2.3.1
  The test framework used to develop the acceptance tests was Selenium.
  
  ### 2.3.2
  Automated Acceptance Tests [Location](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge/blob/main/playersforge/selenium.py)
  
  ### 2.3.3
  [Acceptance Test](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge/blob/main/playersforge/selenium.py#L41)\
  The test_signup() method brings up the local address that PlayersForge ran on and starts at the homepage. The Selenium bot then clicks the 'Login' section, which brings
  it to the login page, then clicks the 'Sign up' section, which brings it to the sign up page. Once the bot is at the sign up page, the bot enters an email, username, and  password, then clicks submit. After that, the bot is brought to its new profile page.
  ### 2.3.4

  ### Results
  #### Myles Abril
  - How do you like the design of PlayersForge?\
  I like it! I like the colors, the layout, the logo is okay. Everything is visible and easy to read. Nothing seems out of place.
  - Move around each page, do you like the designs of the other pages?\
  Yes, I really like it, everything is very user friendly. I really like the shadows. There is empty space on the mods page but I'm sure you could put graphics in those areas if you kept working on it.
  - View and download a mod from the Homepage/Featured Mods page. How do you feel about the process?\
  Very easy, painless, and pretty nifty.
  - Is there something that you would change about the process?\
  Maybe links for mod information, more description, or videos of the mod. It'd be cool to be able to move through multiple pictures for a mod.
  - Try making an account with PlayersForge. Was it difficult to find the signup page?\
  It's very easy to find the signup page.
  - If so, how and what would you change?\
  N/A
  - Upload a fake mod. How did you feel about this process?\
  It was seamless, smooth, and very easy. I would make it fo to the users profile immediately after uploading a mod. I would also have it preview the mode before publishing.
  - If you could change certain aspects of the current website, what would you do?\
  Maybe have a games section.
  - How would you rate the website from 1-10 and why?\
  I would rate it as a 10 because it's really cool and it's different from other websites. It is very inviting and makes me wana download stuff. It makes me happy before I destroy my games with all the mods I download.
  #### Daniel Smith
  - How do you like the design of PlayersForge?\
   It's great! The layout is simple but easy to understand. The home page is an eye catcher.
  - Move around each page, do you like the designs of the other pages?\
    I like the designs. They mesh well together and none of them feel like shouldnâ€™t belong there. 
  - View and download a mod from the Homepage/Featured Mods page. How do you feel about the process?\
    The process is very simple and intuitive.
  - Is there something that you would change about the process?\
    I can't think of something at the moment.
  - Try making an account with PlayersForge. Was it difficult to find the signup page?\
    It wasn't difficult at all. I found the page without a hassle.
  - If so, how and what would you change?\
    N/A
  - Upload a fake mod. How did you feel about this process?\
    The process wasn't complicated. I think anyone could do it without a problem.
  - If you could change certain aspects of the current website, what would you do?\
    A search option would be really cool if you take in account a lot of people uploading mods. Different way to categorize mods/games would also be nice.
  - How would you rate the website from 1-10 and why?\
    I would rate it a 9. There is a lot to love about the site. There is also a lot of potential when it comes to categorizing and searching for mods. The layout of the site is nice and if it were fully developed I would definitely use it. Overall, I love it.
 
  
  #### Zach (last name not provided)
  - How do you like the design of PlayersForge?\
  It's better than stuff like GameBanana, but it feels really empty.
  - Move around each page, do you like the designs of the other pages?\
  They're about the same.
  - View and download a mod from the Homepage/Featured Mods page. How do you feel about the process?\
  I don't see anything wrong with the process.
  - Is there something that you would change about the process?\
  One somewhat related thing is that the description is wrong, it should give the mod description instead of the game description.
  - Try making an account with PlayersForge. Was it difficult to find the signup page?\
  Nope.
  - If so, how and what would you change?\
  N/A
  - Upload a fake mod. How did you feel about this process?\
  I didn't dislike anything about it.
  - If you could change certain aspects of the current website, what would you do?\
  I think it just needs to not look so empty. Maybe add more stuff in your webpages.
  - How would you rate the website from 1-10 and why?\
  It's about a 6 maybe. If there were more functions and more options on the site then I think it would be pretty usable.

  ### Reflections
  
  #### Myles Abril
  After the user evaluation with Myles, I came to a conclusion that the main changes of the website that could pull in users are more features. Myles thoroughly enjoyed the design of the website, and mainly brought up some additions to the uploading process and the overall website. It seemed as though the website was easy to navigate, and pleasing to look at. Myles performed each task as expected, though, he is an avid gamer and has experience in using previous modding websites, which could have given him an advantage.


  #### Zach
  I conclude that the website is functionally okay but feels a bit empty because of our lack of features. There wasn't much about the existing features that needed changing, but the website doesn't feel complete (and frankly it isn't). The processes for downloading and uploading files turned out to be fine for Zach, especially as someone with past experience with modding websites.

  #### Daniel Smith
  The evaluation with Daniel went well. His input gave me the idea that there is a lot of potential to the site and more features such as a search and categories option would be amazing additions. Daniel went through all of the tasks with ease. Although he plays a lot of games and has experience in the modding community, he made it clear that the website would be able to be used by newcomers to gaming and the modding community.
